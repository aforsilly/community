Wiggles is a 1v1 battle on an 11x11 board with 121 food. He is very tough to beat, so we also have a second bounty snake. Wiggles will be our entry in the bounty snake tournament.

Krom's challenge is a 2v1 battle on a 13x13 board with 10 food. Both of the Krom-snakes are very aggressive, and they'll both be targeting the challenger.
